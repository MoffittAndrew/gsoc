## Project proposal 
_Length: max 1 page_

- **Synopsis**

    Briefly explain: what is the project about? Why is it important? What are the goals? What are the deliverables? How would the open source community benefit from this project?

- **Implementation timeline**

    Please include the following information:
    1. A bullet point list with **minimal set of deliverables**
    2. Additional **stretch goals** or "if time allows" deliverables (optional)
    3. A detailed **weekly timeline**: when do you plan to do what? 
        - Please use a week as a minimal unit of time, and include any planned vacations or other commitments. 
        - This timeline could be formatted as a table. 
        - Remember to also include the number of hours per week you plan to work on the GSoC project. 
        - When estimating the required time for a task, keep in mind deliverables should include investigation/research, coding and documentation. 
        - The default schedule for GSoC is 12 weeks - see the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) for precise dates. 
        - Also please specify any prep work you plan to do during the "Community bonding period".
        - Usually week 1's deliverables already include some code. Week 6 marks the mid-term point, where usually more than half of the project should be completed. At the end of week 11 you may want to try to "freeze" the code and complete any remaining tests or documentation in weeks 11 and 12.

- **Communication plan**

    I expect to have some kind of active direct message channel with my mentor (for asking for help when needed, sharing short progress updates whenever something is accomplished or seeking review/feedback on a piece of work), and a weekly stand-up meeting (through a video call platform which allows screen sharing, as this will likely be useful) to go over progress over the past week and to plan next steps, ensuring that I am staying on track. I am also flexible to more/less communication, and through different means if that works best for the mentor.

## Personal statement

_Length: max 0.75 page_

- **Past experience.** 

    Please describe your past experience with programming, open source, or any other experience you deem relevant for the project you are applying for. Any successful open source projects, published work or content of the like should definitely be highlighted.

- **Motivation: why this project?**

    Why are you interested in this specific project? What aspects of it motivate you to work on it? How does it link to your personal or professional interests? How do you envision its impact in the open source community?

- **Match: why you?**

    Why should we choose you for this project? What unique skills or experiences can you bring to the project and the community? Is there something you have worked on in the past that makes you particularly well-suited for this project?

- **Availability**

    I have exams until the 23rd of May, however I will still be free to participate during the community bonding period (but unable to commit large portions of my time). I will be unavailable during the week beginning 30th June, and the week beginning 4th August, leaving 10 weeks during the standard coding period in which I can work 35 hours a week to allow enough time to complete the project. I will also be unavailable during the week beginning the 1st September - this is after the standard coding period ends, but will have an impact if the time to complete the project is extended.

## GSoC

- **GSoC experience**

    From this program, I am hoping to gain valuable experience working with a mentor who has in-depth knowledge and experience in the world of open source, 

- **Are you also applying to projects with other organisations in GSoC 2025?**

    I am not applying to any other projects.
